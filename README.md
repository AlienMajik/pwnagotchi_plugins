Age, Strength, Network Points, and Stars Plugin for Pwnagotchi
**NEW**: Enhanced plugin with achievement tiers, configurable titles, decay mechanics, and progress tracking.

Author: AlienMajik
Version: 2.0.1
Description

This Pwnagotchi plugin extends your Pwnagotchi‚Äôs user interface and functionality by adding several exciting stats and features:
Key Stats:

    Age (‚ô• Age): Tracks how many epochs your Pwnagotchi has lived, now without any reliance on the AI brain.
    Strength (Str): Reflects how much your Pwnagotchi has "trained," increasing every 10 epochs.
    Network Points (‚òÖ Pts): Earn points by capturing handshakes, with the number of points determined by the encryption strength of the networks encountered:
        WPA3: +10 points
        WPA2: +5 points
        WEP/WPA: +2 points
        Open/Unknown: +1 point
    Stars (GTA-Style) with Tiered Symbols: Every 1000 handshakes grants one additional star, up to a maximum of 5 stars.
        0‚Äì4,999 handshakes: Stars appear as ‚òÖ.
        5,000‚Äì9,999 handshakes: Stars appear as ‚ô¶.
        10,000+ handshakes: Stars appear as ‚ô£.

This provides a fun, evolving visual progression as your handshake count climbs. The plugin also counts existing handshakes in /root/handshakes, so you never start from zero!

All stats (age, strength, network points, and handshake count) are persisted in /root/age_strength.json, ensuring that your Pwnagotchi remembers these values across reboots. Every points increment is also logged in /root/network_points.log for easy review.

No AI Brain Required: Age and strength calculations no longer rely on the AI model, making the plugin simpler and more stable.

Works on Jayofelony 2.9.2 and up Images: Fully compatible with the Jayofelony 2.9.2 Pwnagotchi and up images.

New Enhancements in v2.0.1:

    Achievement Tiers:
        Unlock new titles based on your activity. Titles like WiFi Deity, Handshake Titan, and Unstoppable await!
    Configurable Titles:
        Adjust and customize your Age and Strength titles to match your style.
    Decay Mechanics:
        Stay active or lose points! Inactivity for too many epochs results in points decay to encourage ongoing engagement.
    Progress Tracking:
        Track your network points and handshakes using a star system. Reach milestones and level up with stars!
    UI Enhancements:
        Dynamic updates for when you level up or change titles. Get motivational messages when you reach new achievement tiers.
    Persistent Stats:
        Age, Strength, Points, and Stars survive restarts.
    Points Logging:
        A dedicated log file (/root/network_points.log) records each points increment, along with network details.
    Stars System:
        Earn stars as you collect handshakes, with tiered symbols inspired by GTA‚Äôs wanted level system.
    Initialization from Existing Handshakes:
        Already have a collection of handshakes in /root/handshakes? The plugin counts them once on load, so you don‚Äôt lose progress.

Features:

    Persistent Stats: Age, Strength, Points, and Stars survive restarts.
    UI Integration: Stats are displayed directly on the Pwnagotchi screen.
    Points Logging: A dedicated log file (/root/network_points.log) records each points increment, along with network details.
    Stars System:
        Stars (GTA-Style) with Tiered Symbols: Every 1000 handshakes grants one additional star, up to a maximum of 5 stars.
            0‚Äì4,999 handshakes: Stars appear as ‚òÖ.
            5,000‚Äì9,999 handshakes: Stars appear as ‚ô¶.
            10,000+ handshakes: Stars appear as ‚ô£.
        Inspired by GTA‚Äôs wanted level system.
    Initialization from Existing Handshakes:
        Already have a collection of handshakes in /root/handshakes? The plugin counts them once on load, so you don‚Äôt lose progress.

With Version 2.0.1, your Pwnagotchi can now level up in style with achievements, new titles, and a decay system that keeps things exciting! Update now to track your progress and show off your milestones. üéÆüî•

ADSBsniffer.py:
A plugin that captures ADS-B data from aircraft using RTL-SDR and logs it.
a RTL-SDR Dongle is required to run plugin
1. Connect the RTL-SDR Dongle

First, connect your RTL-SDR dongle to one of the USB ports on your Raspberry Pi (the hardware running Pwnagotchi). Ensure the dongle is properly seated and secure.
2. Access the Pwnagotchi Terminal

To configure the RTL-SDR and test rtl_adsb, you'll need to access the terminal on your Pwnagotchi. You can do this in several ways:

    Directly via Keyboard and Monitor: If you have a monitor and keyboard connected to your Raspberry Pi, you can access the terminal directly.
    SSH: If your Pwnagotchi is connected to your network, you can SSH into it. The default username is usually pi, and the password is raspberry, unless you've changed it. The IP address can be found on the Pwnagotchi screen or through your router's DHCP client list.

3. Install RTL-SDR Drivers and Utilities

Once you're in the terminal, you'll likely need to install the RTL-SDR drivers and the rtl_adsb utility. Pwnagotchi is based on Raspbian, so you can use apt-get to install these packages. Run the following commands:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rtl-sdr

4. Verify RTL-SDR Dongle Recognition

After installation, verify that the RTL-SDR dongle is recognized by the system:

rtl_test

This command checks if the RTL-SDR dongle is properly recognized. You should see output indicating the detection of the dongle. If there are errors or the dongle is not detected, ensure it's properly connected or try reconnecting it.

5. Run rtl_adsb

Now, try running rtl_adsb to see if you can receive ADS-B signals:

rtl_adsb

This command starts the ADS-B reception. If your RTL-SDR is set up correctly and there are aircraft in range, you should see ADS-B messages appearing in the terminal.

Add adsbsniffer.py to /usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/installed-plugins and /usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/availaible-plugins

In /etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml file add: 

main.plugins.adsbsniffer.enabled = true
main.plugins.adsbsniffer.timer = 60
main.plugins.adsbsniffer.aircraft_file = "/root/handshakes/adsb_aircraft.json"
main.plugins.adsbsniffer.adsb_x_coord = 120
main.plugins.adsbsniffer.adsb_y_coord = 50

Neurolyzer Plugin:
The Neurolyzer plugin introduces a significant enhancement to the Pwnagotchi platform, aiming to augment the device's stealth and privacy capabilities. Its main function is to automate the randomization of the MAC address for the designated Wi-Fi interface. This action helps make the Pwnagotchi less visible to network monitoring systems, thereby decreasing its digital footprint within the networks it scans. The plugin offers several noteworthy features:

    Varied Operational Modes: It introduces different modes of operation, including a 'stealth' mode. When activated, this mode triggers periodic changes to the device's MAC address, effectively masking its identity. This is particularly useful for operating within networks that are under strict surveillance.

    Adjustable MAC Address Change Interval: The plugin allows users to customize how frequently the MAC address changes, providing control over the degree of stealth based on the user's needs.

    User Interface Enhancements: Leveraging Pwnagotchi's existing UI framework, the Neurolyzer plugin offers immediate visual feedback on the device's screen. It displays the current mode of operation ('stealth' or 'normal') and the time until the next MAC address change. These interface elements are adjustable, enabling users to customize their display positions as needed.

    Wi-Fi Interface Customization: Users have the flexibility to define which Wi-Fi interface the plugin should manage, catering to devices with multiple or unconventional interface names.

    Seamless Activation/Deactivation: The plugin assesses its activation status upon loading, based on the configured settings, and commences its functions automatically if enabled. This feature allows for a hassle-free transition to stealth mode.

    Comprehensive Logging: The Neurolyzer plugin meticulously logs key events and potential errors during its operation. This aids in monitoring the plugin's performance and simplifying troubleshooting processes.

In essence, the Neurolyzer plugin significantly bolsters the Pwnagotchi's capability for stealthy operations, ensuring users can engage in ethical hacking and network exploration with an enhanced level of privacy. Through its thoughtful integration with the Pwnagotchi ecosystem, the plugin elevates the device's functionality, aligning with the objectives of privacy-conscious users and ethical hackers.

Requirements: Flask
Sudo apt install macchanger

1.When installing macchanger choose no on change mac address on startup.

2.Add neurolyzer.py to /usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins
