# ADSBsniffer Plugin

A plugin that captures ADS-B data from aircraft using RTL-SDR and logs it.

## Requirements
A RTL-SDR Dongle is required to run this plugin.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Connect the RTL-SDR Dongle
First, connect your RTL-SDR dongle to one of the USB ports on your Raspberry Pi (the hardware running Pwnagotchi). Ensure the dongle is properly seated and secure.

### 2. Access the Pwnagotchi Terminal
To configure the RTL-SDR and test rtl_adsb, you'll need to access the terminal on your Pwnagotchi. You can do this in several ways:

- **Directly via Keyboard and Monitor:** If you have a monitor and keyboard connected to your Raspberry Pi, you can access the terminal directly.
- **SSH:** If your Pwnagotchi is connected to your network, you can SSH into it. The default username is usually pi, and the password is raspberry, unless you've changed it. The IP address can be found on the Pwnagotchi screen or through your router's DHCP client list.

### 3. Install RTL-SDR Drivers and Utilities
Once you're in the terminal, you'll likely need to install the RTL-SDR drivers and the rtl_adsb utility. Pwnagotchi is based on Raspbian, so you can use apt-get to install these packages. Run the following commands:
     
```bash
sudo apt-get install rtl-sdr
```

### 4. Verify RTL-SDR Dongle Recognition
After installation, verify that the RTL-SDR dongle is recognized by the system:

```bash
rtl_test
```

This command checks if the RTL-SDR dongle is properly recognized. You should see output indicating the detection of the dongle. If there are errors or the dongle is not detected, ensure it's properly connected or try reconnecting it.

### 5. Run rtl_adsb
Now, try running rtl_adsb to see if you can receive ADS-B signals:

```bash
rtl_adsb
```

This command starts the ADS-B reception. If your RTL-SDR is set up correctly and there are aircraft in range, you should see ADS-B messages appearing in the terminal.

## Installation

Add `adsbsniffer.py` to `/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/installed-plugins` and `/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/available-plugins`

In `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml` file add: 

```toml
main.plugins.adsbsniffer.enabled = true
main.plugins.adsbsniffer.timer = 60
main.plugins.adsbsniffer.aircraft_file = "/root/handshakes/adsb_aircraft.json"

- Scheduled retries are managed via a priority queue.

**Why It's Better:**
- Persistence: Keeps trying tough targets without overwhelming the system.
- Resource Management: Prevents rapid, repeated attempts that could cause issues.

### 5. Handshake Deduplication and Quality Check ✅

**What's New:**
Ensures only unique, valid handshakes are processed.

**How It Works:**
- Deduplicates handshakes using a hash-based system.
- Validates handshakes with aircrack-ng, requiring at least two EAPOL frames.

**Why It's Better:**
- Accuracy: Avoids redundant processing and false positives.
- Reliability: Ensures only usable handshakes are counted.

### 6. Dynamic Concurrency Based on System Resources 🛡️

**What's New:**
Adjusts the number of concurrent attack threads based on CPU and memory usage using psutil.

**How It Works:**
- Monitors system load with `psutil.cpu_percent()` and `psutil.virtual_memory().percent`.
- Scales threads (e.g., from 50 to 10) if usage exceeds thresholds (50% or 80%).

**Why It's Better:**
- Stability: Prevents crashes or slowdowns, especially in Maniac Mode.
- Adaptability: Works across different hardware or load conditions.

**Note:** psutil is a cross-platform library for retrieving system information. It's used here to monitor CPU and memory usage, allowing ProbeNpwn to dynamically adjust its concurrency and keep your Pwnagotchi stable during intense operations. If not already installed, you can add it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-psutil
```

### 7. Additional Attack Vector: Fake Authentication Flood 💣

**What's New:**

**How It Works:**
- Randomly triggers association attacks with a 0.05s delay.

**Why It's Better:**
- Diversity: Captures handshakes from APs resistant to deauthentication.
- Aggression: Boosts attack frequency, especially in Maniac Mode.

### 8. Enhanced UI with Handshake Count 📊

**What's New:**
The UI now displays the total number of captured handshakes.

**How It Works:**
- Added to the Pwnagotchi screen at configurable coordinates.

**Why It's Better:**
- Visibility: Real-time feedback on handshake captures.
- Motivation: See your success instantly.

## Why You'll Love It

ProbeNpwn v1.3.0 is your handshake-capturing Swiss Army knife:

- **Smart & Aggressive:** Tactical for strategy, Maniac for mayhem.
- **Efficient:** Scoring and concurrency optimize every attack.
- **Relentless:** Retries and floods leave no handshake behind.
- **Stable:** Keeps your Pwnagotchi happy under pressure.

Big props to Sniffleupagus for the original Instattack—this builds on that legacy! 🙏

- **Improved Snooper Identification**: Spots potential snoopers with more accurate detection logic—devices that move beyond a customizable threshold (default: 0.1 miles) across at least three detections within a time window (default: 5 minutes) are flagged, reducing false positives. Uses the Haversine formula (Earth's radius = 3958.8 miles) to calculate movement.

- **Whitelisting**: Exclude specific networks (e.g., your home Wi-Fi or personal devices) from being logged or flagged to keep your data focused. Configurable via the whitelist option (e.g., ["MyHomeWiFi", "MyPhone"]).

- **Automatic Data Pruning**: Deletes detection records older than a configurable number of days (default: 30) to manage database size and keep it efficient. Runs on startup with a DELETE query based on a cutoff date.

- **Interactive Map**: Displays all detected devices on a dynamic map with sorting (by device type or snooper status), filtering (all, snoopers, or Bluetooth), and the ability to pan to a network's location by clicking on it in the table. Markers are blue for regular devices and red for snoopers.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Shows live counts of detected networks, snoopers, and the last Bluetooth scan time (e.g., "Last Scan: 14:30:00") directly on the Pwnagotchi UI at position (7, 135).

- **Customizable Detection**: Fine-tune movement and time thresholds to define what qualifies as a snooper, tailored to your needs.

- **Reliable Bluetooth Scanning**: Includes a retry mechanism (up to three attempts with 1-second delays) for more consistent device name retrieval via hcitool name, ensuring better accuracy. Detects devices with hcitool inq --flush.

- **Threaded Scans**: Bluetooth scans run in a separate thread every 45 seconds (configurable), ensuring smooth performance without interrupting other operations.

- **Better Logging and Error Handling**: Improved logging for GPS warnings (e.g., unavailable coordinates) and Bluetooth errors (e.g., hcitool failures), making it easier to debug and maintain.

## Requirements

Before installing SnoopR, ensure you have the following:

- **GPS Adapter**: Connected via bettercap (easily done with the gps plugin). GPS is essential for logging device locations.
    
- **Bluetooth Enabled**: Required for Bluetooth scanning. Ensure Bluetooth is activated on your Pwnagotchi (`sudo hciconfig hci0 up`).
    
- **Internet Access (for Viewing)**: The device you use to view the web interface (e.g., your phone or computer) needs internet to load map tiles and Leaflet.js. The Pwnagotchi itself doesn't require an internet connection.

## Installation Instructions

You can install SnoopR in two ways: the easy way (recommended) or the manual way. Here's how:

### Easy Way (Recommended)

1. **Update Your Config File**  
   Edit `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml` and add the following lines to enable custom plugin repositories:

   ```toml
   main.confd = "/etc/pwnagotchi/conf.d/"
   main.custom_plugin_repos = [
   "https://github.com/jayofelony/pwnagotchi-torch-plugins/archive/master.zip",
   "https://github.com/Sniffleupagus/pwnagotchi_plugins/archive/master.zip",
   "https://github.com/NeonLightning/pwny/archive/master.zip",
   "https://github.com/marbasec/UPSLite_Plugin_1_3/archive/master.zip",
   "https://github.com/wpa-2/Pwnagotchi-Plugins/archive/master.zip",
   "https://github.com/cyberartemio/wardriver-pwnagotchi-plugin/archive/main.zip",
   "https://github.com/AlienMajik/pwnagotchi_plugins/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
   ]
   main.custom_plugins = "/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins/"
   ```

2. **Install the Plugin**  
   Run these commands to update the plugin list and install SnoopR:

   ```bash
   sudo pwnagotchi update plugins
   sudo pwnagotchi plugins install snoopr
   ```

That's it! You're ready to configure SnoopR.

### Manual Way (Alternative)

If you prefer a hands-on approach:

1. **Clone the SnoopR plugin repo from GitHub**:

   ```bash
   sudo git clone https://github.com/AlienMajik/pwnagotchi_plugins.git
   cd pwnagotchi_plugins
   ```

2. **Copy the Plugin File**  
   Move snoopr.py to your Pwnagotchi's custom plugins directory:

   ```bash
   sudo cp snoopr.py /usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins/
   ```

   Alternatively, if you're working from a computer, use SCP:

   ```bash
   sudo scp snoopr.py root@<pwnagotchi_ip>:/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins/
   ```

## Configuration

To enable and customize SnoopR, edit `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml` and add the following under the `[main.plugins.snoopr]` section:

```toml
main.plugins.snoopr.enabled = true
main.plugins.snoopr.path = "/root/snoopr"                  # Directory for the database
main.plugins.snoopr.ui.enabled = true                     # Show stats on the Pwnagotchi UI
main.plugins.snoopr.gps.method = "bettercap"              # GPS source
main.plugins.snoopr.movement_threshold = 0.2              # Distance (miles) for snooper detection
main.plugins.snoopr.time_threshold_minutes = 5            # Time (minutes) between detections
main.plugins.snoopr.bluetooth_enabled = true              # Enable Bluetooth scanning
main.plugins.snoopr.timer = 45                            # Bluetooth scan interval (seconds)
main.plugins.snoopr.whitelist = ["MyHomeWiFi", "MyPhone"] # Networks to exclude
main.plugins.snoopr.prune_days = 30                       # Days before pruning old data
```

### Available Options

- **enabled**: Set to true to activate the plugin. Default: false
    
- **path**: Directory for the SQLite database (e.g., /root/snoopr/snoopr.db). Default: /root/snoopr
    
- **ui.enabled**: Show stats on the Pwnagotchi UI. Default: true
    
- **gps.method**: GPS data source (only "bettercap" supported). Default: "bettercap"
    
- **movement_threshold**: Minimum distance (miles) a device must move to be flagged as a snooper. Default: 0.1
    
- **time_threshold_minutes**: Time interval (minutes) between detections for snooper checks. Default: 5
    
- **bluetooth_enabled**: Enable Bluetooth scanning. Default: false
    
- **timer**: Interval (seconds) between Bluetooth scans. Default: 45
    
- **whitelist**: List of network names (SSIDs or Bluetooth device names) to exclude from logging. Default: []
    
- **prune_days**: Number of days to retain detection records before pruning. Default: 30

After editing the config, restart your Pwnagotchi to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart pwnagotchi
```

## Database Schema Updates

On startup, SnoopR checks the detections table for channel and auth_mode columns using PRAGMA table_info. If missing, it adds them with ALTER TABLE commands, logging the updates (e.g., [SnoopR] Added "channel" column to detections table) for seamless compatibility.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, SnoopR runs automatically when you power up your Pwnagotchi. Here's how it works:

- **Wi-Fi Logging**: Logs Wi-Fi access points with details like MAC, SSID, channel, authentication mode, encryption, signal strength, and location. Skips whitelisted SSIDs during on_unfiltered_ap_list.
    
- **Bluetooth Scanning**: If enabled, scans for Bluetooth devices every timer seconds using hcitool inq --flush, logging their details and locations. Retries name retrieval up to three times with hcitool name.
    
- **Snooper Detection**: Flags devices as snoopers if they move beyond movement_threshold across at least three detections within time_threshold_minutes. Updates the is_snooper flag in the networks table.
    
- **Whitelisting**: Excludes specified networks from being logged or flagged during Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scans.
    
- **Data Pruning**: Automatically deletes old detection records from the detections table on startup if older than prune_days.

### Monitoring the UI

Your Pwnagotchi's display will show real-time stats (if ui.enabled is true):

- Number of detected Wi-Fi networks and snoopers
- Number of detected Bluetooth devices and snoopers (if enabled)
- Time of the last Bluetooth scan (e.g., "Last Scan: 14:30:00")

### Viewing Logged Networks

To see detailed logs and the interactive map, access the web interface:

1. **Connect to Your Pwnagotchi's Network**  
   - Via USB: Typically 10.0.0.2
   - Via Bluetooth tethering: Typically 172.20.10.2

2. **Open the Web Interface**  
   In a browser on a device with internet access:
   - USB: http://10.0.0.2:8080/plugins/snoopr/
   - Bluetooth: http://172.20.10.2:8080/plugins/snoopr/

3. **Explore the Interface**  
   - **Table**: Lists all detected networks with sorting (by "Device Type" or "Snooper") and filtering ("All Networks," "Snoopers," or "Bluetooth Networks").
   - **Map**: Shows device locations—click a network in the table to pan the Leaflet.js map to its marker (blue for regular, red for snoopers) with popups showing details.
   - **Scroll Buttons**: "Scroll to Top" and "Scroll to Bottom" for easy navigation of long lists.

## Notes

- **Database**: All data is stored in snoopr.db in the directory specified by path.
- **Data Pruning**: Detection records older than prune_days are automatically deleted to manage database size.
- **GPS Dependency**: Logging requires GPS data. If unavailable (latitude/longitude = "-"), a warning is logged, and Bluetooth scans are skipped.
- **Web Interface Requirements**: The viewing device needs internet to load Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap tiles.
- **Bluetooth Troubleshooting**: If scanning fails, ensure hcitool is installed and Bluetooth is enabled (`sudo hciconfig hci0 up`).
- **Logging**: Improved logging for GPS and Bluetooth issues (e.g., [SnoopR] Error running hcitool: <error>), aiding in debugging.

# SkyHigh Plugin

## Overview

SkyHigh is a custom plugin for Pwnagotchi that tracks nearby aircraft using the OpenSky Network API. It displays the number of detected aircraft on your Pwnagotchi's screen and provides an interactive map view via a webhook, featuring detailed aircraft types (helicopters, commercial jets, small planes, drones, gliders, military), DB flags, and flight path visualization. Distinct icons enhance the map, and a pruning feature keeps the log clean by removing outdated aircraft data.

## What’s New in Version 1.0.9

- **SkyHigh 1.0.9 introduces significant enhancements for richer aircraft tracking and visualization:**

- **Authenticated API Access:** Optional OpenSky account credentials (opensky_username, opensky_password) enable higher API request limits and access to flight track data, with fallback to anonymous access if credentials are invalid or unavailable.

- **Flight Path Visualization:** View recent flight paths (up to 4 hours) for each aircraft by clicking its map marker, with fallback to locally stored historical positions if flight track access is restricted.

- **Enhanced Aircraft Categorization:** Identifies helicopters, commercial jets, small planes, drones, gliders, and military aircraft based on manufacturer, model, typecode, and DB flags.

- **Type-Specific Icons** New map icons for commercial jets (blue), small planes (yellow), drones (purple), gliders (orange), and military aircraft (green), alongside helicopters (red).

- **Extended Data Fields:** Includes velocity, true track, vertical rate, geo altitude, squawk, and on-ground status in the webhook table and map popups.

- **Updated Pruning Default:** Reduced default prune_minutes from 10 to 5 for more frequent log cleanup.


## Why It Works

- **Authenticated API Integration:** SkyHigh leverages the OpenSky Network API with optional authenticated access for higher request limits and flight track data. It fetches real-time aircraft data within a configurable radius of your Pwnagotchi's GPS or static coordinates, ensuring accurate and current information.

- **Dynamic GPS Support:** With a GPS adapter connected to BetterCAP, SkyHigh uses real-time coordinates for precise tracking. Without GPS, it falls back to default coordinates set in the configuration.
  
- **Efficient Data Management:** A pruning mechanism removes aircraft data older than a specified time (default: 10 minutes), keeping the log file lightweight and relevant.

- **Rich Visual Feedback:** The plugin updates the Pwnagotchi screen with the aircraft count and provides a webhook with an interactive map and detailed table, including flight path visualization and type-specific icons for an enhanced user experience

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** Queries the OpenSky API every 60 seconds (configurable) to retrieve aircraft data within the specified radius, supporting both anonymous and authenticated requests.

- **Metadata Enrichment:** Fetches detailed metadata (model, registration, DB flags, type categorization) for each aircraft using its ICAO24 code, with robust handling for missing data.

- **Flight Path Fetching:** Retrieves recent flight paths (up to 4 hours) for aircraft, falling back to locally stored historical positions if flight track access is unavailable.

- **Pruning:** Aircraft not seen within the prune_minutes interval are removed from the log to maintain efficiency.

- **UI Display:** The Pwnagotchi screen shows the number of detected aircraft, refreshed periodically.

- **Webhook Map:** The webhook (/plugins/skyhigh/) renders a table with extended aircraft details (velocity, track, squawk, etc.) and an interactive map with type-specific icons and clickable flight path visualization.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- A Pwnagotchi device with internet access.
- GPS Adapter: For dynamic tracking, simply connect a GPS adapter to your Pwnagotchi and configure it with BetterCAP. The plugin will use real-time coordinates if available, falling back to static ones otherwise.
- (Optional) A GPS module for dynamic coordinate tracking.
